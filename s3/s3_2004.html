Special emphasis is put on the description of complex networks appearing in nature and society, such as Internet. Theoretical models which successfully explain some of the features of real complex networks are introduced. The model of preferential attachment of Barabási and Albert, along with some of its elaborations, is studied in particular. The main results of theoretical models are verified in numerical simulations of the network growth.

Its importance in many systems, from simple chemical to the most complex biochemical multienzime complexes, arouses vital scientific interest for more than 50 years. In recent years in particular, hydrogen-bond research has strongly expanded in depth as well as in breadth, new concepts have been established, and the complexity of the phenomena considered has increased dramatically.  
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">The goal of this project is to introduce students to the basic concepts of the formation and vibrational properties of the intermolecular complexes with weak hydrogen bonds. The systems which will be considered include 1,1'-bi-2-naphthol as an example of proton-donor, and, as a proton-accepting compounds, N,N-dimethylformamide and m-dinitrobenzene in several solvents from polar to nonpolar. From the previously acquired infrared spectra, the formation constants and basic thermodynamic properties will be determined. Also, analysis of the spectra will give a look into the structural details of the complexes. Last but not the least, complexes will be crystalised to obtain monocrystals good enough to carry out x-ray difractional structural analysis.

                        <p class="project">In such a way, students will be introduced to molecular vibrational spectroscopy, to «mechanical» properties of the molecules and weak intermolecular forces, and also to basic properties of solutions. Methodology of the spectral analysis and experimental techniques will be accompanied with lectures and discussions.

                        <p class="project">One of the top challenges in astrophysics today is direct imaging of extra-solar planets. Direct imaging of extra-solar planets is highly desirable because one could separate the light from the star and the planet. However, such imaging is difficult. The most prominent is very wide dynamic range of the light intensities from the stars. To achieve that range participants of this group will try some of new techinics of data reduction on original VLT (Very Large Telescope-ESO) images. With the indirect method (Radial velocity) planet's wobbling around the parent star is measured. This has led to the discovery of about 110 planets in our galaxy. Another goal of this project will be to determine which of those known planets are in or close to place around the star where life could develop - in so-called Habitable zone. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">Participants will be expected to learn how to search scientific databases, form the goal of their research, do basic data reduction of astronomical images, make conclusions and present their work to public. The planet hunting season will yield exciting results soon.
