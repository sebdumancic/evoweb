                                        Sebastijan has found his interest in science by reading  Jules Verne's works, especially 20 000 miles under the sea. Unalbe to build his own Nautilus, he become interested in computer science, since he was raised up by two informaticians. After  writing his first programs in Logo, he was convinced it was the right choise for him.

                                        Sebastijan joined the Summer School of Science in summer of 2012 as project leader, in charge of  a project about computer science and recognizing music taste.  He was impressed with the motivating atmosphere and passion of young students and educators, so he decided to come back as an organizer. Futhermore, he is also an active member of <a href="http://mnm.hr/"><strong>Young Gifted Mathematicians „Marin Getaldić“</strong></a> and one of the organizers of Young Mathematicians Summer Camp. After his work in those Schools, he has found that educating is the way for him.<br /><br />

                                        He is currently a PhD student at the KU Leuven, Belgium. His main research interests are in the field of machine learning - computer algoruthms that teach themselves how to solve a particular problem. He is particulary interested in modelling unobserved aspects of such problems.  One of his main preoccupations is music. He has been playing French horn for 12 years now. For two years, he has been a part of <a href="http://www.mideurope.at/index.php/en/wywop.html"><strong>World Wind Youth Orchestra Project</strong></a> in Schladming, Austria.</p>

                                        When Petra was a child, her mother said – ‘When you find a career that you really like, it is like you won a jackpot!’ When she started studying molecular biology, Petra really won a jackpot because she found something that fulfilled her. During her studies, Petra had different interests, ranging from cell biology and biochemistry to biophysics and computational biology. She went on two internships in Germany, working on the protein import to chloroplasts (plant biochemistry), as well as the homeodomain protein classification (computational biology). Although her studies were demanding, Petra also found time for student exchange by actively working in the <a href="http://www.iaeste.org/"><strong>IAESTE</strong></a> student union as a group coordinator.

                                        Popularization of science has become a part of Petra's life after the first year of the <a href="http://nocbiologije.biol.pmf.unizg.hr/"><strong>Night of Biology</strong></a> in 2009. After hearing some awesome stories about the Summer School of Science, she was introduced to the School in the same year, by doing a workshop on homemade DNA isolation. Petra was quite astonished by the spirit of the School, people that worked there and the enthusiasm of the highschool students. In 2012  she returned to the School with her own projectand a year later as an organizer. The same year she became a part of the Society for Out of Frame Education, actively involved in the variety of projects considering science education among the highschool students. This year Petra is looking forward to repeat a journey of the Summer School of Science co-organization, shoulder to shoulder with ambitious young people willing to share their knowledge and hands-on experience as well as their scientific stories.

                                        Unlike today, as a kid Matilda watched a lot of TV. Fortunately for her, TV had something to offer back then, and one her favourite shows was <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284735/">“Il etais une fois la vie”</a></strong>. This everlasting French cartoon, telling the story about human body and all those invisible amazing processes that are going on in there, made her want to learn more about the minute world of molecules and chemicals that surround us. During high school, thanks to her biology and chemistry teachers, her love for science was sparked even more, so she decided to study at Faculty of Sciences. She finished her BSc in Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb, after which she moved to Germany to do her MSc at the University of Heidelberg. Currently, she is a PhD student in genomics at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (<strong><a href="http://www.embl.de/">EMBL</a></strong>) in Heidelberg, trying to find out what is the importance of the maysterious non-coding genome in the embryonic development.

She first came to the School as a high school student, and then kept coming back in various roles from swapshop leader, random visitor, technical support, project leader… She also took part in other science popularization events such as <a href="http://nocbiologije.biol.pmf.unizg.hr/"><strong>Night Of Biology</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.paris-montagne.org/festival"><strong>Paris-Montagne</strong></a>. Knowing how much inspiration and motivation one can get from the Summer School, she accepted the tough job of the organizer without hesitation. She is looking forward to meeting new bright minds and science enthusiasts, and bringing them all together at this very special Summer School.

                                        For Jelena it all started even before primary school. While loving to watch TV and cartoons, Jelena’s thorough obsession were documentaries, especially ones by  <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough">David Attenborough</a></strong>. She also enjoyed putting puzzles together, usually making it more challenging by turning the pieces upside down. As she went to school, biology and math grew up on her and she especially got interested in human diseases and parasites. What better way to combine the passion for solving problems and natural phenomena than by learning more about these things? Although she was hesitant towards which program to enroll to, she decided to combine the passion for math and human biology by becoming a student at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, where she obtained her B.Sc and M.Sc in Molecular Biology. She recently finished her PhD at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (<strong><a href="http://www.embl.de/">EMBL</a></strong> Heidelberg) in a field of genomics. Although she considers herself to be a molecular biologist, she spends most of her time sitting in front of a computer screen performing computational analyses on large genetic variations found within and between different populations. In her free time Jelena likes to read a lot, watch movies, write her beauty blog and travel.

                                        Jelena joined the Summer School of Science two years ago for the first time as a project leader, and of course completely fell in love with the whole project, people and the enthusiasm spreading all over the place. When she got the opportunity to organize  last and subsequently, this year's Summer School, she jumped in without hesitation, despite knowing that it will present a big challenge. Even though she is a relatively new member of the Summer School family, Jelena was always inspired to take part in teaching and promoting science as much as she could through various outreach activities, such as <a href="http://nocbiologije.biol.pmf.unizg.hr/"><strong>Night Of Biology</strong></a> and <a href="http://emblog.embl.de/ells/embl-school-ambassadors/embl-school-ambassador-profiles"><strong>EMBL School Ambassador program</strong></a>. This year she cannot wait to see all those new and fresh faces in Požega and share this special experience with them.

                                        Edi already fell in love into science at elementary school, thanks to the irresistible need to blow something up and very tolerable parents. From the first burnt eyebrows to the first successful rocket engine, Edi has compensated the lack of knowledge about highly energetic materials with loads of scientific books. That is how the passion for chemistry and science was born.

                                        Edi joined the S3 in 2013. as a project leader at a project which dealt with synthesis and charachterisation of polymers and in 2014. as a project leader at a project which dealt with hydrogen bonds. Because of exquisite impressions and unsurpassable students, he decided to join in as organiser this year. This school provides unique boost for students who prefer science, but also one-of-the-kind experience for project leaders who want to promote science among younger generations. Also, Edi is a leader of popularisation project „Entropy“ which promotes chemistry among elementary and high school students.

Besides that, he adores to manufacture pyrotechnics, flow into rocket engineering (either in computer simulation or in real world) and make jet engines or anything that rumbles, roars or gives out flames.</p>

                                        Discovering Chemistry at 13 years old and being presented with various experiments with plants and animals in Biology, Mislav quickly became enthused in science. Throughout high school his interest in natural sciences only expanded, as well as his desire to discover new things. His parents home became a makeshift laboratory for a time, which his mother condoned despite her fears that she might find his white mice under her bed.

                                        When he was 16 he participated in the <a href="http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/comenius/comenius_en.php">Multilateral Comenius Project</a> allowing him the opportunity to gain working experience with students in different countries. In 2011 Mislav came to Summer School of Science as a participant. Realising how much of a positive influence it had on him, he decided to continue in 2013 as a swapshop leader, and in 2014 he led a project. The popularization of science is something he is passionate about, so he participated in <a href="http://znanstvenipiknik.weebly.com/">Science Picnic</a>, teaching young students how to isolate DNA from fruit. Mislav is eager to share and gain new experiences this year during the School, with new faces but the same old glow for science.
