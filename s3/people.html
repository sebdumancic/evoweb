                                        Sebastijan has found his interest in science by reading  Jules Verne's works, especially <i>20 000 miles under the sea</i>. Unable to build his own Nautilus, he became interested in computer science, since he was raised up by two informaticians. After writing his first programs in Logo, he was convinced it was the right choise for him.

                                        Sebastijan joined the Summer School of Science in summer of 2012 as project leader, in charge of a project about computer science and recognizing music taste. He was impressed with the motivating atmosphere and passion of young students and educators, so he decided to come back as an organizer. Until now, he has organized S3 camps in years 2013, 2015 and 2017. Previously, he was also a member of <a href="http://mnm.hr/"><strong>Young Gifted Mathematicians „Marin Getaldić“</strong></a> and one of the organizers of Young Mathematicians Summer Camp.

                                        He is currently a PhD student at KU Leuven, Belgium. His main research interests are in the field of machine learning - computer algorithms that teach themselves how to solve a particular problem. He is particulary interested in modelling unobserved aspects of such problems. In his free time, Sebastijan enjoys travelling, cooking and reading.</p>

                                        Long time ago, as a child, Nikolina was amazed by the dinosaurs and would carefully follow each and every documentary about them that was shown on TV. She was amused by the thought that one day she’ll become a palaeontologist and search for new dinosaur species in Chile. It turned out quite differently though. She first became (and remained) fond of mathematics, and in the end realized that her true love is chemistry. This happened sometime during the additional chemistry classes in V. gymnasium that she attended. Everything else naturally followed: she decided to study chemistry at Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, where she obtained her BSc and MSc degrees. She developed a specific fondness for research of protein’s function and dynamics, and is now doing her PhD at KU Leuven, Belgium.

                                        Her Summer School of Science story began in 2013 when she was asked to hold a swapshop at S3++. Although she was previously engaged in science popularization activities such as workshops  within <a href="https://hr-hr.facebook.com/Znanstvenecarolije/"><strong>Magic in Science</strong></a> project and mentoring students in V. gymnasium, S3 experience was something completely new. She fell in love with the Summer School, especially its amazing atmosphere. She believes that for those few weeks the School is absolutely the best and most inspiring place in the world for young science enthusiasts. So she came back to lead a project at S3 2015, and is now back again in the role of S3 2017 organizer.

                                        When Petra was a child, her mother said – ‘When you find a career that you really like, it is like you won a jackpot!’ When she started studying molecular biology, Petra really won a jackpot because she found something that fulfilled her. During her studies, Petra had different interests, ranging from cell biology and biochemistry to biophysics and computational biology. She went on two internships in Germany, working on the protein import to chloroplasts (plant biochemistry), as well as the homeodomain protein classification (computational biology). Although her studies were demanding, Petra also found time for student exchange by actively working in the <a href="http://www.iaeste.org/"><strong>IAESTE</strong></a> student union as a group coordinator.

                                        Popularization of science has become a part of Petra's life after the first year of the <a href="http://nocbiologije.biol.pmf.unizg.hr/"><strong>Night of Biology</strong></a> in 2009. After hearing some awesome stories about the Summer School of Science, she was introduced to the School in the same year, by doing a workshop on homemade DNA isolation. Petra was quite astonished by the spirit of the School, people that worked there and the enthusiasm of the highschool students. In 2012  she returned to the School with her own projectand a year later as an organizer. The same year she became a part of the Society for Out of Frame Education, actively involved in the variety of projects considering science education among the highschool students. This year Petra is looking forward to repeat a journey of the Summer School of Science co-organization, shoulder to shoulder with ambitious young people willing to share their knowledge and hands-on experience as well as their scientific stories.

                                        Dora has been showing a great amount of curiosity since her early childhood, constantly questioning and wondering why and how things happen, which has made her a really heavy kid to put up with. Although her love for science has started back then, she has become aware of it in the elementary school. Discovering the world of biology and chemistry was a real turning point in her life. She has  started to participate in competitions and school projects where she has met her peers with the same interests.

                                        My story with science has started a long time ago when I was still a child, I just haven’t known that then. As I learned to count I started to look for patterns around me, in licence plates, tiles, really everywhere you can look I could find a mystery of numbers and shapes, and I still enjoy a good mystery series or novel. As I grow up I found out that science is a grate tool for solving mysteries and put your curiosity in a good use, and that is how I decided to become an engineer. So, I am now a student at Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing in Zagreb, and studying to become an electrical engineer.

So two years later, as I just finished my first year in college, I came back as a Swapshop leader. It was a great experience, everyone was so friendly, enthusiastic and creative and the atmosphere was even better then I remembered. From there my motivation for teaching and promoting science just grew, I became more active in college where I am a demonstrator in several classes and I volunteered at Night of Science. When I was offered a place as a technical assistant at this year’s Summer school I jumped right in, and was ready for a new challenge and lots of new great people to share this experience with.

                                        Unlike today, as a kid Matilda watched a lot of TV. Fortunately for her, TV had something to offer back then, and one her favourite shows was <strong><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0284735/">“Il etais une fois la vie”</a></strong>. This everlasting French cartoon, telling the story about human body and all those invisible amazing processes that are going on in there, made her want to learn more about the minute world of molecules and chemicals that surround us. During high school, thanks to her biology and chemistry teachers, her love for science was sparked even more, so she decided to study at Faculty of Sciences. She finished her BSc in Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb, after which she moved to Germany to do her MSc at the University of Heidelberg. Currently, she is a PhD student in genomics at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (<strong><a href="http://www.embl.de/">EMBL</a></strong>) in Heidelberg, trying to find out what is the importance of the maysterious non-coding genome in the embryonic development.

She first came to the School as a high school student, and then kept coming back in various roles from swapshop leader, random visitor, technical support, project leader… She also took part in other science popularization events such as <a href="http://nocbiologije.biol.pmf.unizg.hr/"><strong>Night Of Biology</strong></a> and <a href="http://www.paris-montagne.org/festival"><strong>Paris-Montagne</strong></a>.

She is looking forward to meeting new bright minds and science enthusiasts, and bringing them all together at this very special Summer School.

                                        For Jelena it all started even before primary school. While loving to watch TV and cartoons, Jelena’s thorough obsession were documentaries, especially ones by  <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Attenborough">David Attenborough</a></strong>. She also enjoyed putting puzzles together, usually making it more challenging by turning the pieces upside down. As she went to school, biology and math grew up on her and she especially got interested in human diseases and parasites. What better way to combine the passion for solving problems and natural phenomena than by learning more about these things? Although she was hesitant towards which program to enroll to, she decided to combine the passion for math and human biology by becoming a student at the Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb, where she obtained her B.Sc and M.Sc in Molecular Biology. She recently finished her PhD at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (<strong><a href="http://www.embl.de/">EMBL</a></strong> Heidelberg) in a field of genomics. Although she considers herself to be a molecular biologist, she spends most of her time sitting in front of a computer screen performing computational analyses on large genetic variations found within and between different populations. In her free time Jelena likes to read a lot, watch movies, write her beauty blog and travel.

When she got the opportunity to organize  last and subsequently, this year's Summer School, she jumped in without hesitation, despite knowing that it will present a big challenge. Even though she is a relatively new member of the Summer School family, Jelena was always inspired to take part in teaching and promoting science as much as she could through various outreach activities, such as <a href="http://nocbiologije.biol.pmf.unizg.hr/"><strong>Night Of Biology</strong></a> and <a href="http://emblog.embl.de/ells/embl-school-ambassadors/embl-school-ambassador-profiles"><strong>EMBL School Ambassador program</strong></a>.

                                        Discovering Chemistry at 13 years old and being presented with various experiments with plants and animals in Biology, Mislav quickly became enthused in science. Throughout high school his interest in natural sciences only expanded, as well as his desire to discover new things. His parents home became a makeshift laboratory for a time, which his mother condoned despite her fears that she might find his white mice under her bed.

                                        When he was 16 he participated in the <a href="http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/llp/comenius/comenius_en.php">Multilateral Comenius Project</a> allowing him the opportunity to gain working experience with students in different countries. In 2011 Mislav came to Summer School of Science as a participant. Realising how much of a positive influence it had on him, he decided to continue in 2013 as a swapshop leader, and in 2014 he led a project. The popularization of science is something he is passionate about, so he participated in <a href="http://znanstvenipiknik.weebly.com/">Science Picnic</a>, teaching young students how to isolate DNA from fruit. Mislav is eager to share and gain new experiences this year during the School, with new faces but the same old glow for science.

                                        Now he is a fourth-year student at the School of Medicine in Zagreb. His main interest is the connection between medicine and molecular sciences, especially on a cellular level, and the application of new discoveries in treating human diseases. In his free time he enjoys watching movies, reading books and hanging out with friends.</p>

                                        Dunja loved solving crosswords and puzzles during childhood. Later her passion shifted to solving mathematical problems and equations and was sure that her future will revolve around mathematics and computational biology. During her last year in primary school she won the second place on state competition in maths and as prize, won a chance to take part in Summer School of Science. There she took a part in a project whose aim was to transform bacteria with fluorescent proteins. Participating in this school opened her doors into a new world of biological sciences which changed her life dramatically. After, she participated in three more summer schools, every time meeting peers with similar interests and working on projects from various scientific fields. In the end she decided that computational biology is the filed that interests her the most. She finished BSc and MSc in Molecular Biology at University of Zagreb and now is perusing a PhD in regulatory genomics at Imperial College London, working on a project that is looking at combinatorial regulation of gene expression during the embryonic development.

                                        Dunja believes that because of good science popularization, her life path changed and that’s the reason she tries to do the same thinking that she might influence others. She took various roles in organization of open days of her former faculty (“Noc Biologije”) as well as volunteering on Science Festival organized by Imperial College. In 2015 she came back to S3 as project leader.  In her free time, she enjoys cooking and experimenting with exotic ingredients as well as travelling and spending time in nature.
