                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2017/MolGas_Project_Pic.jpg" width="250" height="200" hspace="9" align="right" />Did you ever sit in a class wondering ‘why do I have to know what atmospheric pressure is’ or ‘who cares how to calculate the volume of a sphere’? Well, no matter what you do: science is omnipresent. Have you ever noticed how when you boil an egg, egg white goes from slimy and transparent to firm, white matter? This phenomenon is caused by denaturation of egg-white proteins. The heat coming from your stove denatures proteins by disrupting bonds that held molecules in shape. In the case of  hard-boiled eggs, the proteins clump together and solidify, causing the egg white and yolk to harden. Of course, even without this knowledge, people have known how to boil an egg for centuries – but in the last couple of years, we started understanding what causes some dishes to taste great and some to be awful. Scientific knowledge enables us to improve and develop recipes using science. This is how molecular gastronomy was born and many new delicious meals could be served.

                        </p>

                        <p class="project">In this project, we will try to figure out why some good old-fashioned cooking techniques actually work. We will start with disentangling the science behind techniques ranging from phase transitions to protein-stability. Also, we will use modern molecular cooking techniques to see if we can develop some surprising new dishes and flavors! After that, we will do some food-based experiments, to finally put our culinary knowledge to the test in a grand finale.

                            Dunja is a PhD student in computational genomics at Imperial College London, where she investigates what drives precise gene expression in embryonic development. As a high schooler she attended S3 in Visnjan and fell in love with science. Together with her interest in computer sciences she decided to study molecular biology with tons of computational courses. This summer school will be her second time leading a project. In addition, she attended this school for 4 times, did a swapshop and was technical assistant last year.  When she is not at her computer doing science, Dunja is surprise-surprise cooking :-D, travelling or swimming in Thames…

She did her masters in process engineering and molecular biotechnology, though officially she was in Wageningen, she spent most of her time abroad. During her masters she got more and more interested in the mechanisms that cells use to adapt to their environment. Now, during her PhD at ETH Zurich (Switzerland), she is trying to find out how bacterial species use different protein-metabolite interactions to make fast decisions when their environment changes. When Marieke is not in the lab, she is mostly painting, in museums or theatre, or running around in the forest near the campus.

                    <h3><strong><a name="p1" id="p1"></a>INVESTIGATION OF AERODYNAMIC PROPERTIES</strong></h3>
                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2017/Kruno_Project_Pic.jpg" width="280" height="200" hspace="9" align="right" />Aerodynamics studies the motion of air and, today, it is one of the most important driving factors in the design of many products like transport vehicles, buildings, bridges and many more. Every shape is special for itself and every shape's feature has certain influence to its aerodynamic properties. If the evolution of car design is considered, it can be noticed that in the beginning cars had a “box” shape, featuring lots of “sharp” edges. In the 40’s cars were curved and took on the “teardrop” shape while in the 70’s design returned to a “box” shape. Aerodynamics was known before the first cars were produced but its influence on the design was minor because of small driving speeds and no concerns for the fuel consumption. Car design was governed by fashion. Today, cars are designed to incorporate optimized aerodynamic features to improve the car’s aerodynamic parameters, making an “aerodynamic shape”.
 
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">Aerodynamics is a subfield of fluid dynamics which is one of the most complex physical phenomena. Fully describing the flow of the fluid is still on the list of the unsolved mathematical and physical problems, making it a “million dollars” question. During this project, the theoretical concepts of Bernoulli and Navier-Stokes equations will be presented to explain the physics, logic and complexity of the fluid flow. The aim of this project will be to understand how the shape of an object influences its aerodynamic properties with the use of a wind-tunnel testing rig to measure the aerodynamic properties and a 3D printer to manufacture test objects. Computational simulations will be presented to show the latest aerodynamics research methods.

                     <h3><strong><a name="p1" id="p1"></a>Discovering the Laws of Physics with Artificial Intelligence</strong></h3>
                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2017/3_AIIsaacNewton.jpg" width="250" height="200" hspace="9" align="right" />Since their advent, computers have had a great impact on how science is conducted. Nowadays, it is unimaginable to  unearth the hidden information of experimental data in the natural sciences without the assistance of computer programs.  Instead of merely utilizing computer programs to assist in evaluating experiments, one can also integrate computer programs into the scientific endeavor more thoroughly by writing computer programs that simulate real world phenomena. For example,  the scientific discoveries made at the Large Hadron Collider in Geneva, Switzerland would never have been possible without simulations. A more novel stream of computers assisting scientists in their work is the ‘artificial scientist’ or ‘robot scientist’. The goal here is to leverage artificial intelligence to discover laws of nature that reign one’s experiments. These laws are, given the complexity of experiments, not perceivable to humans but can be found by computer algorithms. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">In this project we are going to investigate the interplay between physics and computer science. To this end we will approach this symbiosis from two different roads. On the one hand, we are going to simulate simple physical systems like a bouncing ball or the harmonic oscillator. This includes transforming the laws of physics that describe these systems into computer code. On the other hand, we are going to use these simulated experiments to investigate how one can learn the laws that govern physical system. In other words, can we learn from data provided by our simulations the theoretical laws that produced the simulations in the first place?

                    <h3><strong><a name="p1" id="p1"></a>Ship response to the heavy waves in the Adriatic Sea</strong></h3>
                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2017/Luka_Project_Pic.jpg" width="320" height="190" hspace="9" align="right" />Ship motion in heavy sea is a challenging task for scientists, engineers and seafarers. Every day, thousands of ships sail along the seas and a great number of them navigate on winds and waves which affect their safety. The planning of sailing routes is essential for avoiding heavy seas and increasing ship safety. The dynamics of the ship motions on the waves are demanding mathematical problems for which many solving methods have been developed. Big waves and heavy seas occur also on the Adriatic Sea and present a seakeeping problem that has to be solved, almost on a daily basis, for passenger and merchant ships. 
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">This project will deal with a fast, but sufficiently accurate, method that can help to estimate motions of a passenger ship in the Adriatic Sea during waves and winds like bura and jugo. Participants will have a short introduction into what seakeeping is and the mathematical explanation of the problem. After understanding the project goals, participants will choose an appropriate ship, route, and waves in the Adriatic Sea. The problem of ship motions and the choice of the optimal route will be solved by a state-of-the art and fast semi-analytical method. After solving an imaginary problem, participants will make telephone/Skype contact with a captain of a passenger ship on the Adriatic Sea and will try to predict sea states and motions for the next voyage. In that way they will validate the methods and their knowledge.

Would you be happy to access the hidden genetic secrets of your genome, or would you prefer not to know? Humankind reached the point when it is fairly easy and cheap to obtain the sequence of the human genome – you order a package online, provide the company with your biological material (saliva), and within a month you can access your genetic info online. And then what? What can you do with your genetic information? Well, google it!
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">The Internet is a miraculous source of information today, but a careful interpretation of obtained data is a MUST. In this project we will interpret the results of 23&me genotyping procedure for 3-5 individuals. To analyze these genotypes a publically-available information and databases such as OpenSNP or PGP (Personal Genome Project) will be used. We will dive into the world of the human genome and potentially (a) analyze the genetic structure of present human populations, (b) identify and annotate regions of the genome that might be similar to ancient human genomes, or (c) focus on genetic variation and its connection to personalized medicine and genetic counselling.

                          Inga Patarcic is a PhD Student at Bioinformatics Platform Group, BIMSB, Berlin. She started to analyze biological questions using computational methods as a high-school student at V. Gymnasium Zagreb. Around the same time, she participated at S3+ as a student. A decade after, she is equipped with the background in molecular biology, knowledge of population genetics, and faith in the future of her PhD (to successfully associate human genes with corresponding regulatory regions). In her humble opinion, the best free-time activity is climbing.

                        <p class="project"><img src="img/2017/Sharon_ProjectPic.jpg" width="210" height="190" hspace="9" align="right" />The term skin microbiota refers to the collection of microorganisms present on the human skin. Human skin microbiota comprises all three domains of life (bacteria, fungi and archaea) and the microorganisms are able to colonize many different sites, also called “niches” of the skin.  The microbiota functions to protect human skin, for example by preventing the colonization of pathogenic microorganisms and triggering the immune system. However its dysregulation might lead to different skin diseases, such as psoriasis and acne. So what can we do to protect ourselves from the vile bacteria? We can use soap! One of the most effective measure to prevent hospital infections is hand washing. But how effective is this?
 
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">The goal of this project is to identify differences in hand microbiota composition due to hand washing using soap. We will start with the cultivation of bacteria on our hands, before and after washing with soap. We will follow up on these bugs and characterize them based on morphology, biochemical properties and antibiotic resistance. Furthermore, we will use further molecular biology techniques to finally identify hand microbiota, especially those gone mad.

                                    Many events can't be predicted with total certainty. This is why probability, a wonderfully intuitive and applicable field of mathematics developed. It started in 17th century when gambling games got more sophisticated, stakes higher, so gamblers turned to mathematicians to help them determine what to bet on. Here we will study the basic concepts of probability by performing an experiment using Galton board, also known as Bean machine. We will discover mathematical formulas behind the results and see how answering this question helps us predict test scores, hights of people in generation etc.

                                   Have you ever been wondering how bots can play rudimental games like chess or even some sophisticated games like Starcraft? State space search algorithms help computers mimic human thinking and find quick way to solve problems. State space search algorithms represent the basics for artificial intelligence which is a field of study in computer science. In this swapshow we will introduce couple of different algorithms to solve basic state space search problems and also explain how they can be upscaled for more complicated situations. In our simple example we will try to program movement of Packman through a maze and help him collect all food dots and avoid ghosts.<br/><br/>

It is the fastest, easiest and most effective way of making digital models come to life. In this workshop students will get the basics of printing followed by using 3D modeling software to create their objects. After the object is printed, we will engage in post processing and focus on the special capabilities of additive manufacturing such as customization, self-assembly and the ability to print complex objects. <br/><br/>

With the discovery of DNA as the hereditary molecule, we started to use genetic information to unravel these relationships. Understanding how genetic information evolves over time helps answer some biological questions, but it is also useful in practical applications. Here we will find out how scientists analyze DNA and determine relationships between species. We will have to solve a common laboratory problem – the mislabeling of samples, and discover where the mysterious sample DNA comes from by using PCR and gel electrophoresis. We will also dive in computational analysis of DNA by sequence alignment and construction of phylogenetic trees. <br/><br/>

                                        We all know that burning fossil fuels brings many problems for Earth and we should reduce emission of carbon into atmosphere, but real question is how? Can one person do something to help? The goal of this workshop is to demonstrate that there is a way to help. In the last 20 years, the cost of photovoltaic cells (solar panels) has dropped by a factor of 20, with a good tendency to keep dropping and solar power plants are being built nowadays all around world. The students will learn how to construct solar powerplant on several different examples (house, boat, school, etc.). They will brush up on terms like electrical power, voltage, current, capacity and then design and build their own photovoltaic power plant system for charging mobile phones. <br/><br/>
