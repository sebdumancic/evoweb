The goal of the group is to build a functional optical trap that uses highly focused light beam to capture and move spheres of one micrometer in diameter. By recording its motion, we will explore properties of free and confined Brownian motion. If time permits, we will briefly study cell motility.

For instance, muscular tissue expresses a variety of proteins required to perform physical movement, whereas skin tissues express other proteins, which build a barrier and protection of the organism against various environmental stress. In this project, students will analyze muscle tissue from fish and learn how to visualize and to purify a specific set of proteins. Results obtained from different fish samples will be compared to the existing evolutionary trees. The relationship between genetic information, protein expression and cellular function will be extended in individual theoretical and bioinformatical projects. Experimental part will be accompanied with lectures and discussions and scientific communication skills are introduced through designing posters and presentations.

This concept that not so long ago belonged in science fiction magazines, came to life with the advent of cheap, mass-producible embedded computers and sensors. With industrial, scientific, agricultural and even military applications, wireless sensor networks, sometimes referred to as 'smart dust', are a fascinating solution to many previously insurmountable everyday problems.

                        <p class="project">The project will give the students a flash-overview of wireless communications, and will then focus on wireless sensor networks. Routing, reliable delivery, and evolving network topologies will be discussed in the context of specific applications. The students will be asked to design, implement and test a simple routing algorithm that will execute on a Telos-series wireless sensor network.

Protein sequence, i.e. the order of amino acids in its chain is unique for every protein, as well as their three-dimensional arrangement. Protein 3D structure is necessary for deeper understanding of its function- however, it is a very challenging task to obtain it experimentally. A major goal of structural bioinformatics is to predict the 3D structure from the protein sequence. One method that can be applied is homology modeling, a procedure that develops protein 3D structure based on its sequence and the known structures of similar (homologous) proteins.
                        </p>

                        <p class="project">The students will each be given a different protein sequence to study. They will learn how to extract the wealth of information stored in a protein sequence, like establishing evolutionary relationship between proteins and getting hints on their structure and function in the cell. The tertiary structure of a protein will be obtained by homology modeling through a series of computational steps.  </p>

This group experiments with low-speed impact craters of different balls in sand and aims to derive scaling laws describing the behavior without full theoretical understanding of the processes involved. Furthermore, a simple numerical impact simulation can be developed and compared to real data.
