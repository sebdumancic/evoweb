The organisation is an expression of a strong commitment to teaching, and a strong belief in the power of science to reach out across all kinds of boundaries of nationality and belief.

Dora, Martina, Jovan and Tomislav got the chance to play with laser and discover some of the phenomena in physical optics; like diffraction, interference and polarization and get a sense of how laws that govern those phenomena can be applied to calculate some cool stuff like distance between bits on a CD or between erythrocytes on coating</em> <br>

I’ve met many excellent people both students and lecturers/swapshop leaders who gave me a lot of useful advice which will help me in my future career. I gained knowledge and a lot of friends during this school, everything was so well organised (with perfect ratio of hard work and fun/free time). I hope that in the future this school will grow and become more popular and that, one day,I will come back to it: either as a lecturer, swapshop leader or something else.</em> <br>

Learning from them about science is great, but It's also wonderful to hear them talk about life, success and failures, and realize what are the things that really make somebody a leader in also a lot about teamwork and other cultures which were brought together based on common interests. It was great to meet so many, I could say, global peers who are all so ambitious and wellrounded, possibly future leaders in science and I think that friendships and connections are a valuable thing the school brought us, and it will probably be a while before we realize the full impact it had on us.</em> <br>
