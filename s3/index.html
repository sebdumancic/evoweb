				<b>Summer School of Science</b> is an international summer workshop established in 2001. It is organized by <b>Society for Out-of-Frame Education</b> in Po≈æega (Croatia). The program aims at high school students and offers a diverse range of research projects and lectures in the fields of science and technology.
                </p>

                <p class="main2">Summer School of Science is organized in two camps: <b>S3</b> (for grades 9 and 10) and <b>S3++ </b>(for grades 11 and 12), where students get a chance to work in small groups on a real scientific project, guided by a mentor. This is accompanied by evening lectures from eminent scientists from all over the world. Due to our international friends and colleagues, the official language of the School is English.
                </p>

                <p class="main2">More information about the projects, daily activities, application process and practical information can be found on this website.

                    	<strong>Summer School of Science</strong> is a unique place where like-minded individuals of all ages get together to share their enthusiasm for knowledge and <strong>discovery</strong>. Talented and highly motivated students, often neglected in their regular school environments, are presented with personal challenges that build self-confidence and encourage them to &quot;<strong>think big</strong>&quot;. In an open and informal atmosphere, students and their mentors from all over the world  work in teams and exchange ideas freely. Together they find <strong>inspiration</strong> and courage to achieve more once they are back in their home environments. They form long-lasting relationships that not only help their individual careers, but also promote international and intercultural understanding. Our creative mentors, devoted to scientific and personal excellence, teach through <strong>passion</strong>. They use personalized approach to every student, making sure everyone has the best experience possible.

                	<p class="main2">
                    	Beyond popularization of science, we aim to create a global network of high school students, young scientists and social entrepreneurs who are committed to building <strong>knowledge-based societies</strong>. We see Summer School of Science as a platform for personal growth. In our community, every generation takes care of the younger one, ensuring continuation of our volunteer-based project. Former school participants often become mentors themselves and stay involved by supporting the school in various ways. We encourage and nurture leadership skills by providing young people with challenges of project design, mentoring and organizing events. By bringing together young leaders of different nationalities, we hope to provide a model for similar projects in other countries.

You usually learn basic concepts of science in the regular school - about acids in chemistry, about electricity in physics or about genes in biology. This is certainly important for your education, but you are missing a critical part - the scientific method. </p>

						<p class="main2">How do we ask questions about the phenomena in nature? How do we answer them? And how can you be sure about what you've found? The Summer School of Science is the place to learn all about it. Since we believe that the best way to learn is by example and practice, we'll put you in the position of being a scientist. You will work on a very specific topic with a project leader and a team of few other participants. Together, you will specify the problem, design the experiment and analyze the results to answer one of the interesting questions in science.</p>

                        <h4>What does a typical day at the Summer School of Science look like?</h4><br/>
                        <p class="main2">
                            Depending on the project, you will either stay in the school or go to do terrain work. Project work is directed by your mentor. It usually starts at 9 AM and finishes at 6 PM. Most of the work will be done during the day, but night field trips or lab visits are not excluded. Every evening, there is at least one lecture or a workshop attended by all the participants together. <br>
                            One day is reserved for the excursion. Except for a short break after lunch, don't expect too much free time.
                        </p>

                        <p class="main2">
                            A lot of fun, if you like science. It can also be pretty usefull, if you plan to study science at the university. You usually learn basic concepts of science in school - about acids in chemistry, about electricity in physics or about genes in biology. This is certainly important for your education, but you are missing a critical part - the <strong>scientific method</strong>. <br/>

The Summer School of Science is the place to learn all about it. Since we believe that the best way to learn is by example and practice - we'll put you in the position of the scientist. You will work on a very specific topic with a project leader and usually two other participants.
                        </p>


                    
                        <h4>Do I have to know a lot about the topics in advance?</h4><br/>
                        <p class="main2">
                          At this stage you should not worry weather you know enough science to do it. Science is so specialized nowadays that often you have to start from zero. But what is important: do you know how to learn? If you can do it in the school, you can certainly do it here. In any case, project leader is there to answer all your questions.

                        </p>


                    
                        <h4>What kind of people come to the Summer School of Science?</h4><br/>
                        <p class="main2">
                            The Summer School of Science is a unique place because you can meet other high school students with interests in science. You will also meet lots of people who work in applied or fundamental sciences. Some of them are your project leaders, others are lecturers. Working with some of them you will learn another thing about science - it is about people. You have to be able to work in the team, present and share your ideas, but in the same time listen and respect the others. <br />
                              And when it comes to <strong>communication</strong> - you will have to practice that as well. You will have several chances to present your work and results.
                        </p>

                    
                        <h4>Why is English the official language?</h4><br/>
                        <p class="main2">
                           Because today it is practically official language of science. Most of the scientific literature is written in English, and most of the communication at conferences or summer schools happens in English. If you choose to study chemistry, biology or physics you will have to use textbooks written in English very early. So this is a good way to start. Don't worry if your English is not perfect, if you can communicate and express you ideas- it is enough!

                        Po≈æega is located 178 km from the city of Zagreb, the capital of Croatia, and 100 km from Osijek, the biggest city in Slavonia. It is well connected by bus lines and highway (nearest exits are Nova Gradi≈°ka, Lu≈æani and Slavonski Brod) to all major cities in Croatia. If you are going by train, you need to change train in Nova Gradi≈°ka or Batrina (you can also take a bus from Nova Gradi≈°ka). For those who wish to fly, the closest airports are in Zagreb and Osijek.

                        <em>Note</em>: Bear in mind that the School takes place during the busy tourist season, so book a bus or plane seat early. Inform us on the exact time of your arrival once you know it.

                    <p class="main2">
                        Participants sleep in rooms with multiple beds, in a hotel near the local Gymnasium where most of our activities take place. The breakfast is prepared each morning by the participants themselves in the school‚Äôs cantina. Lunch and dinner are prepared in a nearby restaurant and brought to the school.      
                    </p>
                    <p class="main2">
                        <em>Note</em>: If you are a vegetarian, or have other special food requirements, please notify the school organizers in advance.

                    <p class="main2">
                        Since the School takes time in the middle of summer, it is often quite warm in Po≈æega (it can get up to 35 ¬∞C). So pack light clothes (T-shirts, shorts etc). In case of bad weather, or possible work during the night, it might be good to have some warm clothes with you as well. Sneakers and sunscreen are good to take for the field trip. Mosquito repellent might come handy as well. Clean sheets are provided, but you should bring your own towels. The washing machine will not be available.
                    </p>

                    <p class="main2">
                    	Some participants bring their own calculators, digital cameras and laptops - but they are not required, since if needed will be provided. Some participants bring their musical instruments to make a nice atmosphere during the leisure time.
                    </p>

                    <p class="main2">
                        IMPORTANT:<br />
                        <strong>If you have a medical condition (like allergies or any other chronic condition), make sure you bring enough medication and notify the organizers in advance!</strong>
                    </p>
