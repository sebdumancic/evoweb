								<p class ="main2">Interested in electric cars? S3 has just the lecturer to talk to. We will host <b>Tomislav Babić</b>, developer at <b>Rimac Automobili</b>, the famous Croatian car manufacturer.</p>

                                <p class="main2">He is a graduate of The Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing of the University of Zagreb where his studies were mostly focused on the field of <b>computer vision</b>. After graduating, Tomislav worked on developing backend and web applications for banking applications and music streaming industries, among others. Currently, he's working as a part of the team responsible for figuring out how electric cars can communicate with each other and with the environment.</p>

                                <p class="main2"> Tomislav will talk to us about his work in Rimac Automobili, the development of the <b>electric car</b>, and the next steps in its development. As the world is getting more connected and moving closer towards the realisation of the Internet of things, cars will become an important connectivity element. In this vein, Tomislav will cover the company's web services and their approach in creating a connected electric hyper-car.</p>

As the director of Jet Propulsion Theatre, a project that <b>narrates science by the means of theatre</b>, he is engaged into inspiring the audience and enriching their scientific knowledge. His aim is to allow people to understand science and the people of science in a whole new way, by developing a sense on curiosity and wonder. As a play-writer,  he has written and performed several plays all over the world. His plays touch upon the most advanced topics in science and make them reachable to anyone. His play <b>“The Principle of Uncertainty”</b> talks about the wonders of quantum mechanics, while his other plays talk about time (<b>“Taking Out Grandpa”</b>) and space travel (<b>“Pale Blue Dot”</b>).</p>

                                <p class="main2">During his stay in Požega, he will hold a workshops about Storytelling techniques in science. Interested in this amazing workshop? <a href="apply.html"><strong>Apply now</strong></a>!</p>

                                <p class="main2">After receiving his PhD in biology from MIT, Prof. Hartwell worked at the University of California, Irvine and University of Washington. His work greatly contributed to the understanding of the <b>cell division cycle</b> (CDC). Using yeast as a model organism, he identified the genes responsible for CDC regulation, as well as mutations in those genes connected to certain types of cancer.</p>

                                <p class="main2">In addition to the Nobel Prize, Prof. Hartwell received Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University, Komen Brinker Award for Scientific Distinction and Albert Lasker Award for Basic Medical Research, among others. He is also a member of the National Academy of Sciences and a former director of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.</p>

She is currently a part of the ATLAS collaboration at CERN looking for other particles which might have Higgs-like properties. Other than this research, she is involved in developing the silicon detectors for particle detectors. She has received several awards and fellowships, such as the Fellowship of the American Physical Society, the Career Advancement Award of the National Science Foundation in the USA, and the Ruth and Joel Spira Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Education.</p>

                                <p class="main2">After studying biochemistry at MIT and neurobiology at Harvard Medical School, Prof Bray returned to the United Kingdom to do research in the field of neurobiology, focused on nerve growth and cell motility. Later he got engaged into development of computational models of cell signalling, with  a primary focus on the molecular machinery of <b>bacterial chemotaxis</b>. For this work, he was awarded the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Award"> <strong>Microsoft European Science Award</strong></a> in 2006. He is also listed among 50 most influential scientists in the world today.</p>

                                <p class="main2">Prof Bray will spend a couple of days at the Summer School, which will give the participants plenty of time to interact with this renowned scientist!

Petra already organized the School twice (2013 and 2015) and Matija is a new addition to the S3 team. However, both are eager to make this School a great experience for everyone.</p>

                                <p class="main2">As this is the fifth edition of the Summer School of Science in Požega, we are preparing interesting projects and lectures to help shape a new generation of young scientists. Stay tuned for more information!</p>
