When filling out the form, you will need to upload a previously prepared <a href="motivation.html"><strong>motivation letter</strong></a> and provide us with contact information of one of your teachers (not necessarily in the science field).

                    <p class="main2">
                        All applications will be reviewed by the school organizers and a certain number of applicants will be selected for  <strong>interviews</strong>. The advantage is given to  students who can benefit the most from the School, since usually there are  more good applicants than available places. Therefore, it is of great importance to write a good <strong>motivation letter</strong>! Interviews will be conducted by telephone or Skype in <strong>mid May 2015</strong>. Students will be notified by  E-mail about the exact time of the interview. Interviews are conducted to asses  student's proficiency in English and his/her personal motivation. Final selection will be announced  in the following week<strong>.</strong> <br /><br />
                        We believe that each applicant who has expressed an interest in science should be given the opportunity to develop professionally. However, due to  lack of  resources, we cannot place all  interested students in one of our camps. Therefore, if you were not selected, it doesn't mean  you were not good enough and you can always try next year. We  still want to maintain contact with you and to offer you  guidance when neded.  Please visit the Summer School of Science <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Summer-School-of-Science-S3-S3/107634203007"><strong>Facebook page</strong></a>. There you can communicate with us, ask questions about science and careers in science, and be informed about many science-related events.

                            Applicants who are selected to participate at the Summer School of Science have to pay a <strong>fee</strong> before the School starts (details about payment methods will be provided after selection process is completed). The fee includes accommodation, food and excursion. Students have to cover their own travel expenses. <br />
                              <br />

                            Croatian citizens pay a reduced fee thanks to the sponsorship of the <a href="http://www.pozega.hr/"><strong><font color="white">City of Pozega</font></strong></a>. The fee for other nationalities reflects the real economic cost of the participation. We are constantly working to find new sponsors in order to further reduce the fee for all participants. If we succeed we will announce new, reduced fee amounts on this website. Please note that we function inside a non-profit organization and all our mentors work <em>pro bono</em>, so we don't run a profit on the School. We invite all interested donors  to <a href="index.html#contact"><strong><font color="white">contact us</font></strong></a>.

                            To help pay the fee, we encourage students to find a <strong>sponsor</strong> (your school, town or a company; international applicants can also try their embassy).&nbsp;Several scholarships are available for Croatian students only. Please see the text below for more information.

                        All applicants  can apply for a  <strong>scholarship</strong>, in which case you don't have to pay the fee. To qualify, you must include a separate letter in your application, explaining your economic situation. This year we are able to give several scholarships to students who need them the most.

                        <p class="main2">
                            Finding a sponsor can seem like a daunting task, especially if you have never tried it before. However, it can give you a lot of benefits. You will get training in <strong>fundraising</strong>, an important skill for students and scientists who often have to find financing for their projects, travel to conferences or studies.
                        </p>
                        <p class="main2">   
                            In order to find a sponsor, consider both big and small, local, national and international companies. Examples are: banks, state or private companies (especially those who benefit from research and development, like pharmaceutical industry), government structures (schools, your city or county, embassy) or non-governmental institutions. Some of them give donations on a regular basis with competitions with fixed deadlines. In your request, you should include a one-page letter explaining your demand and why the School would be good for your education and career. Include the reasons why you are applying to them. We encourage you to add your CV and the <strong>Letter of support</strong> that we can send you.

                <p class="main2">The principal aim of  <strong>Summer School of Science</strong> is to gather people with professional interests in science and technology, and to provide them with practical experience according to our possibilities. Since only about 30 participants can be admitted each year (about 15 per camp), the organisers select students that will benefit the most from  participation. During the<strong> <a href="#process">selection process</a></strong>, they will examine each student's background and motivation through the motivation letter and a telephone interview. Thus, it is of uttermost importance to write a good motivation letter, explaining your future goals and interests.  The letter is a way for organizers to get to know you and understand  the reasons you want to participate.<br />
                </p>

                          <li>A short summary of your educational experiences, practical experience in science and opportunities you have used so far to expand your education (<em>Note</em>: It is NOT necessary to have any prior research experience or participation in science competitions.)</li>
                          <li>Plans for your professional development (i.e. choice of university, if you made it) and what actions  you plan to take  in the following years to develop profesionally (in addition to applying to this camp)</li>

                <p class="main2"> The letter should be at least <strong>200</strong> words long, but it can be as long and you want. <br/>
                Finally, don't be afraid that you will write something &quot;wrong&quot;. Honesty and openness are very much appreciated. </p>
