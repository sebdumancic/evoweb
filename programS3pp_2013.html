      <p>
        <img src="images/2013_S3pp_p1.png" width="302" height="217" hspace="9" align="right" /><em>Field Programmable Gate Arrays</em> (FPGAs) are customizible integrated circuits (ICs) that contain a large number of configurable logic components which can be set to perform virtually any logic function, thus providing the possibility of abstract design of hardware components. They are fast, deterministic, power efficient, natively parallel and reconfigurable. FPGAs are not restricted to any predetermined hardware function, but allow designers to configure the chip using hardware description languages (such as VHDL and Verilog) to perform functions that any application-specific IC (e.g. radio demodulators, video/sound processors, etc.) or general-purpose IC (e.g. CPUs, GPGPUs) could perform. Today, FPGAs can be found everywhere, from software defined radios, to Ethernet routers, and are just plain awesome.      
      <p>The aim of this project will be to design, develop and implement a compact and efficient microprocessor (µP) FPGA core with a small but expandable set of instructions. The µP will then be used to construct a prototype device (e.g. a calculator). Basic concepts of digital logic and electronics will be explained as a basis for digital systems design. Components and operation of a typical µP will be studied in detail. Furthermore, students will get familiar with the general architecture of FPGA chips in order to understand the effect of their design on physical devices, while VHDL and <em>Xilinx</em> development tools will be used to synthesize and verify these designs.

<h3><a name="a2" id="a2"></a>Bottom-up: Synthesis and Applications of Magnetic Nanoparticles</h3>
      <p><img src="images/2013_S3pp_p2.png" width="219" height="219" hspace="9" align="right" />The emerging fields of nanoscience and nanotechnology bring together several fields of science, like chemistry, biology, physics and materials science, to manipulate matter at a molecular or an&nbsp;&nbsp; atomic level. They are still in their beginnings, but the first generation of nanotechnology is already being applied to improve materials, and there is great hope that it may be used in medicine. Nanoparticles are a good example of how the properties of very small pieces of matter may have completely different properties from bulk matter (large amounts): we can think of them as bridging the classical and the quantum properties of matter.</p>
      <p>Our project will have three parts: in part 1, we'll learn how to synthesize iron oxide nanoparticles. These nanoparticles are superparamagnetic, which means they have the uncanny property that, while they're made of a magnetic material (magnetite), they are not magnetic – but they're very easy to manipulate with applied magnetic fields. We'll take the time to learn why this is, and also test several methods to obtain different types of nanoparticles. For the second part of our project, we'll study how we can use magnetic fields to manipulate these nanoparticles and test their effects on cells. Finally, we'll learn some electronics and programming to create a system of magnetic valves for our nanoparticle suspension using electromagnets and electronic prototyping boards. During this you'll learn some chemistry, physics and biology, and get to see for yourself what all of this nanotechnology thing is about! </p>

      <h3><strong><a name="a3" id="a3"></a>Data Mining for Potential Diabetes Biomarkers</strong></h3>
<p><img src="images/2013_S3pp_p3.jpg" width="263" height="270" hspace="9" align="right" />Even though diabetes is thought of as a single disease, there are many types of diabetes, with different diagnosis and different treatments. Maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a rare type of diabetes that is commonly misdiagnosed as Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes. Former are diagnosed with blood or oral glucose tolerance tests, but MODY, hereditary form of diabetes, can only be confirmed with molecular genetic testing, making it expensive and impractical for testing in many countries. While Type 1 diabetes is treated with insulin shots, MODY is treated with oral medications so many patients may spend many years receiving wrong treatment. Glycosylation is one of the most extensive protein modifications, influencing both structure and function of proteins. Due to the non-invasive nature (blood drawing) and the simplicity of glycans quantification, the analysis of the N-glycome has a great potential as a future diagnostic method for various diseases.&nbsp; Recently analysis of glycans bound to plasma proteins in diabetic and control human population have shown a potential for a novel MODY biomarker, so-called DG9-index.
<p>In this project participants will be introduced in process of discovering patterns in datasets. Using various statistical and data mining techniques students will discover how to distinguish MODY patients from the rest of the diabetic population. The main challenge in this project will be to master programming skills in R programming language and apply gained knowledge in analysis of diabetes data sets. During the project students will dive in the field of glycomics and explore efficiency of different glycans and glycan indices as biomarkers for MODY.

<h3><strong><a name="a4" id="a4"></a>Deciphering the Past Using Ancient DNA</strong></h3>
<p><img src="images/2013_S3pp_p4.jpg" width="306" height="231" hspace="9" align="right" />Ancient DNA made its first appearance back in 1984, when a group of scientists led by Ross Higuchi managed to extract tiny trace amounts of DNA from a museum specimen of quagga, an extinct subspecies of the plains zebra. Only a year later, Svante Pääbo extracted DNA from a 2,400 year old Egyptian mummy. With the development of polymerase chain reaction, which uses DNA polymerase to make millions and millions of copies of DNA fragments of interest, the field of ancient DNA suddenly started to grow. Today, we can recover DNA from various archaeological and paleontological remains to study genetic relationships between long extinct organisms and their contemporary relatives. But how far in the past can we go? Is it possible to reconstruct dinosaur or Neandertal genome? </p>
The main goal of this project is to extract and analyze DNA from various bone samples of different age and origin from an archaeological site. We will learn how to excavate bones, set up an ancient DNA laboratory and determine the bone origin at both morphological and molecular levels. There are many opportunities as well as limitations of the field of ancient DNA due to the degradation of DNA after the death of an organism and the contamination of samples with contemporary DNA. Participants of this project will face the challenge to overcome numerous obstacles in retrieving DNA from ancient bone samples as well as interpreting results obtained. Practical laboratory tasks will be accompanied with theoretical knowledge of biochemistry, cell biology and genetics.

<h3><strong><a name="a5" id="a5"></a>How to Kill Superconductivity</strong></h3>
<p><img src="images/2013_S3pp_p5.jpg" width="233" height="306" hspace="9" align="right" />Ever since high-temperature superconductors (high-Tc) were discovered a quarter-century ago, they remain at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics research. Many high-Tc superconducting systems have been made and explored since, but the mechanism of superconductivity remains a mystery. However, it is known that all these compounds contain planar layers made of copper and oxygen atoms, which play a crucial role in conducting current with zero resistance. Our goal is to destroy the superconducting state by replacing some of the copper atoms with both magnetic and non-magnetic impurities. From the effects of different impurities we will gain direct insight into the strange properties of the superconducting planes. Two separate projects - chemical (synthesis of samples) and physical (detailed sample characterization) will cooperate on this topic and, in the end, together draw the main conclusions.

<p><strong>&quot;Synthesis and Doping of Superconducting Ceramics&quot; (Project leader: Damjan Pelc)</strong>: Every investigation of new and strange properties of some material must begin with the chemical synthesis of the material. Superconducting ceramics are relatively easy to make if one has the right tools and ingredients, as we will find out in this project. We will focus on a specific system called YBCO (for YBa2Cu3O7), and employ two methods in synthetizing it and introducing impurities in place of copper atoms - doping - in order to influence its superconductivity. We will analyze the obtained samples chemically - by iodometric titration - and perform simple tests of superconductivity - levitation of magnets - to see which method works best. Our physical colleagues will make precision measurements on our finest samples, and in the end we will join them in analyzing the influence of impurities on superconductivity.<br />
  
<p><strong>&quot;Measuring Magnetism in High-T<sub>C</sub> Superconductors&quot; (Project leader: Tonci Cvitanic)</strong>: Magnetic properties are of great importance in solid state physics, because they give information about the behavior of electrons in the material. High-temperature superconductors, like normal metals, contain many 'free', mobile electrons. But below a certain temperature, Tc, the electrons start to cooperate and conduct current without any resistance. This superconducting state has peculiar magnetic properties, and it is our goal to measure them. We will design and construct an extremely sensitive device for measuring magnetism in materials - an AC susceptometer. Using the susceptometer, we will measure the response of samples with different impurities (provided by the chemical project) in dependence on temperature, from room temperature all the way down below -200°C. We will study the basics of magnetism in materials, learn about the nature of superconductivity, try to predict what different kinds of impurities will do to the superconducting state and compare our ideas to the experimental findings.</p>

<h3><strong><a name="a6" id="a6"></a>Double Trouble: Dynamics of the Double Pendulum</strong></h3>
<p><img src="images/2013_S3pp_p6.jpg" width="300" height="200" hspace="9" align="right" />Attach a little ball to the end of a small wooden stick, hold the stick from the other end, and let it swing. Its motion is periodic, smooth, and predictable - this is an ordinary pendulum. Attach another pendulum to the edge of the first one, however, and the system can behave in a vastly erratic and complex manner. Its motion can be entirely unpredictable. This is the double pendulum - a system that exhibits high sensitivity to initial conditions. Such systems are often termed "chaotic". There are many chaotic systems, both in mathematics and in nature: an abstract non-linear equation can behave chaotically, while Earth's climate is also unpredictable, as rooted in the popular phrase "the butterfly effect". The double pendulum is important in that despite its apparent simplicity (it's much simpler than Earth's climate, for sure), it is a real physical system that exhibits chaos. </p>
<p>In this project, students will explore the mesmerizing dynamics of the double pendulum, by building a physical pendulum and comparing its movement to results suggested by theory. We will focus on the complete creation of both model and the real life system: the mathematical theory requires studying elementary physics, differential equations, and chaos, while constructing and measuring the system demands hammer-and-nail engineering, as well as image processing for motion tracking. Numerical algorithms will be used for solving the equations generated by the model, and hence some computer programming will also be involved. In the end, the students will have integrated a variety of different fields in order to understand chaos a little better, seeing how a seemingly simple system can lead to complex behavior.

      </h3>
      <h3><a name="w1" id="w1"></a> Strange, different and fast: Quantum algorithms </h3>
      <p>Quantum algorithms are much faster than their classical counterparts,  but are significantly different in their essence. Quantum algorithms take  advantage of special properties of quantum mechanics to achieve faster  computing. In order to explore simple quantum algorithms we must first learn  how computers compute. After that a brief introduction to quantum mechanics  will be given in order to understand concepts that will be used by quantum  processors which are the main strength of quantum algorithms. Comparison  between classical and quantum computing will be given, and we will be ready to  write our first quantum algorithm. Our main goal is to construct a quantum  algorithm that will be able to search an unsorted database of <em>N</em> entries in sqrt(N) iterations.</p>

<h3><a name="w2" id="w2"></a> Tricky  Flu viruses make yearly trouble. Why?</h3>
      <p>Remember going to the  doctor and getting vaccine shots? It is no fun getting poked with a needle, but  fortunately, vaccine gives you protection against a serious illness for years  to come. But what about the flu vaccine? How come there is a new one every  year? This workshop will show why it is important to get vaccinated yearly and  what is it that changes in flu virus from year to year and causes flu outbursts.  To do that, students will have to find the data about flu virus structure and  DNA sequence as well as compounds in vaccines from different years. Learning  how to obtain this data from big biological databases might be very useful for  students and their own future experiments.</p>

<p>Complex compound consists of a metal atom or ion  surrounded by bound molecules or anions that are called ligands. This type of  compounds is common among transition metals and finds its applications in many  different fields of life spanning from industry, photography and dermatology to  chemotherapy. Metal ions surrounded by bound molecules are also  found in many proteins and are of great importance for their function. The aim  of this workshop is to learn something about structure, properties and methods  of synthesis and analysis of this useful compounds. We will also perform an  experiment in which we are going to synthesize a complex compound of unusual  structure and will be confronted with problems that occur in inorganic synthesis  due to properties of certain substances. </p>

<h3><a name="w6" id="w2"></a> Ferrofluids - the wonder of magnetism</h3>
<p>Magnetism, and all that falls under that name, is among the  most complex areas of physics, but hence also provides for some of the most wonderful  physical and natural effects. Accordingly, there exists a large variety of  magnetic materials that have different properties and the search for new ones  is a very active field of research. Within this workshop the participants will  become acquainted with a magnetic material that is strange even for these  standards: a ferrofluid. Ferrofluids are colloid solutions of magnetic  particles so they effectively behave as magnetic fluids.
